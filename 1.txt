    [description] => It's not every day a gem like this comes along. Occupying a sunny corner block and adjacent to leafy Nanbaree Reserve, this impressive family home offers incredible peace and privacy in a tranquil North Harbour setting. You'd be forgiven for thinking you were a million miles away from it all.

Designed with relaxed family living in mind, the extensive floor plan is set over two levels and offers a range of sunlit living areas that flow through to charming outdoor entertaining spaces and gorgeous gardens. There's a resort-style pool, large lawn and paved entertaining area on the lower level, along with an immaculate open plan kitchen, a family and dining room, and handy guest or au pair accommodation.

Upstairs offers even more room with three double bedrooms with built-ins, a study and a sumptuous parent's retreat that includes an ensuite, walk-in robe, a balcony and private sitting room. There's easy access to the front garden through the main living room where you'll find even more lawn for lazing and play as well as a multi-purpose entertaining area with street access that your teenagers will love.

For extra convenience, there's dual car entry from both Valley Rd and Hogan St, but with so much on the doorstep, it's going to be hard to leave for work on Monday. Beautiful bushland, stunning coastal walks, Tania Park and Forty Baskets beach are all at your fingertips, and if you can tear yourself away, there are city buses to whizz you to work and excellent schools nearby to choose from.

    [description] => Built in the 1930's and designed in an English manor style, this grand double brick home is set on an incredible 1150sqm of estate like grounds with some of the best views to Manly. This is truly a unique and special property for the area, rarely available for sale. You'll be captivated from the start.

It exudes all the charm and classic good looks that you'd expect, with space and functionality to maximise the elevated water views of North Harbour, Manly and to the ocean, while providing plenty of room for growing families both inside and out.

The main living level has been transformed with a modern and light open plan design and offers a natural flow through to gorgeous outdoor entertaining areas at the front and back. You'll discover a smart kitchen with an Ilve cooker, a spectacular over-sized conservatory currently set up as a pool room with additional living area, and an expansive sun-drenched deck. And, no matter where you're standing in any of these areas, the never to be built out views are magnificent.

Upstairs offers three wonderfully comfortable bedrooms with built-ins, a family bathroom and extra trimmings such as the chic plantation shutters, and there is another sunny double bedroom and bathroom downstairs - ideal as a guest room, a teen retreat or au pair accommodation.

The truly remarkable feature of this home is the incredible land size, where there are beautiful sprawling gardens to explore. The kids will love the vast level lawn at the front for ball games and fun, and for the green thumbs, the massive level backyard is delightful with citrus trees and huge veggie patch, and enormous lawn area for your own football pitch! Such is the scale of each of the incredible outdoor spaces. 

The home is gorgeous as is, but offers the opportunity to fully capitalise on the incredible parcel of land. With so many options to expand and potentially create a landmark residence for the area, the possibilities are endless.

The icing on the cake is the lifestyle location with stunning coastal walks and harbour beaches, Tania Park, and excellent schools, shopping and transport all an easy stroll away. This impressive home has it all.

WHAT THE OWNERS HAVE LOVED ABOUT THEIR HOME AND LOCATION

The memories, joy and laughter of four generations echo through our Family home.

As a young couple with two young children our late parents bought the home some 60 years ago. Over the following ten years it saw the birth of another five children.

The original part of the home was built circa 1930’s so it oozed charm and character. It was one of the original farm homes as the area back then was market gardens. When our parents went to buy the home it had a milking shed in the backyard and the sale came with a milking cow being included in the sale but apparently Mum and Dad declined.  

As the Family grew the house grew with us to the deceptively large layout it offers today.

Brookvale was the ideal place to raise a family of seven children. The layout with the bedrooms at the front and the separate living areas and the yard meant that there was always a place for everything from a quiet place to read, to a place for gathering together, room for the rough and tumble games of children and a game of football or cricket with the neighbouring families. We have many childhood memories sitting around the open fireplace.

The position of the house meant easy access to anything that was needed - including shops, schools, the beach and sporting fields. If you needed to go further afield it was only a short walk to public transport.

We have always been blessed with great neighbours some of whom have also lived in the area for decades.  

Over sixty years 34 Old Pittwater Road witnessed the growth of a Family - what other house could tell the stories of the more than fifty people from across four generations gathered here every year to celebrate together. It has continued to be the heart of our family long after all the seven children left home. The sale marks the final chapter to the end of an era. We know the next owners will love our Family home and we hope that it will become the heart of another family who will develop their own traditions, tell their own stories and will enjoy happiness - The Sherley Family

    [description] => Boasting a prized 930sqm corner parcel, investors will love the appeal of this home's quiet setting within 10 minutes walk of the new Showground station.

Soaring ceilings emphasise the generous dimensions of the flexible layout, which has potential for a teenager's retreat. A bush outlook is enjoyed beyond the inground pool and established gardens promise minimal maintenance. The home's central location is five minutes to Castle Towers and close to Norwest Business Park, with Castle Hill High School a short walk away.

    [description] => On arrival, it's love at first sight; the breathtaking Pittwater vista from the spacious double carport (with level street access) requires a few moments of grateful appreciation. There's so much to take in, the beauty of the Norfolk pines and gums fringing the boat studded waters around Clareville beach stretching north to Lion Island.  A Palm Beach sea plane gently rises from the water emphasising the Whitsunday vibe.  Imagine the relief of returning here after a day at the office! Pure Magic.

The house is set well away from the road, inviting the visitor to follow the gently meandering stone pathway which weaves its way through lovingly landscaped gardens. There is an immediate sense of peace. The calming call of the Currawongs and the delicious sent of jasmine add to the overall sense of discovering somewhere truly special. Built in the 70's, it feels happy, secure and relaxed - just like coming home.     

•	Blissfully private with Pittwater views
•	Impressive landscaping with valuable established gardens 
•	Open plan kitchen, living and dining flowing to the full length entertaining deck
•	Updated kitchen with oversized smeg oven and gas hob 
•	3 bedrooms upstairs with BIR, Master with ensuite, WIR and Pittwater Views
•	Study nook
•	Lower level has the potential for self-contained accommodation (STCA) with own access, bathroom/laundry, (bedroom 4) queen sized bedroom, lounge/rumpus and rear garden.  
•	Secure under-house storage 
•	Directly on the city express bus route with bus stop at front of house
•	Close to short cut through to Hilltop Road and Hilltop Road shops, and walk into Avalon village
•	450 m walk to Clareville Beach (via stairs)
•	700 m walk to renowned Clareville Kiosk Restaurant (via stairs)
•	Within the coveted Bilgola Plateau Public School catchment area

Basking in northern sunshine, this welcoming home enjoys filtered views over Pittwater.  Picturesque gardens, open plan living and the potential for self-contained accommodation (STCA), combine to create a relaxed family home brimming with potential.  A property you could develop further but more than likely you'll just want to enjoy the tranquillity, kick off your cares and pick up a good book!

    [description] => Presenting a cinematic ocean panorama that stretches from Long Reef up to Bilgola, this expansive dual-level home is a unique opportunity in an exclusive Plateau setting.

The beauty of this property is that it's ready to move into now, yet there is opportunity to add significant value by modernising the current interiors, or even re-configuring the floorplan to fit with your family's needs.

The clear heart of the home is the rear-set living area – a light-filled space where an expanse of windows and doors allow you to connect with uninterrupted views of the ocean. This stunning backdrop, and an expansive amount of alfresco space, creates the perfect conditions for entertaining. A slow combustion fire and hardwood floors inject character and warmth, while the kitchen is well equipped with stone counters and modern appliances.

The sanctuary-like bedrooms are spacious and versatile. Three bedrooms upstairs include built-ins, one has an adjoining study or sitting room, and two of them are configured to face a tranquil and sun-filled atrium. Downstairs is another enormous bedroom with adjoining sitting room and modern en-suite. Two sets of sliding doors open this space up to a covered deck with an alfresco spa bath, before stepping down to the lawn that leads you to the edge of the escarpment.

A double lock-up garage at the front of the house allows plenty of space for the car, a boat and to safely store your belongings, and there is lots of under-house storage and a workshop.

Though this exclusive setting offers complete tranquillity, it is little more than a 10-minute walk to the beach, the revitalised Collaroy Hotel and the Cinema. There are bus services from nearby Hilma Street or city buses from Pittwater Road, and it's walking distance to Narrabeen Lake and Collaroy Plateau Public School.

    [description] => Offering peace, privacy and spectacular ocean and district views, this free-standing home offers a contemporary haven for relaxed family living.

This sophisticated abode is positioned within 'Outlook' – a smart collection of modern homes that are set back from the road and elevated to deliver a stunning panorama that stretches across the district to Dee Why and the ocean beyond.

Spacious and intuitively designed to cater to modern family life, the downstairs living spaces celebrate the idea of indoor/outdoor living, with four sets of sliding doors that allow for easy interactions with various alfresco spaces that surround the house.

To the rear, an entertainer's deck and level lawn look out to the ocean, while the dedicated dining area and designer kitchen with integrated Smeg appliances, island bench and stone counters lead to a courtyard at the front.

Upstairs, the bedrooms are generously scaled and filled with light. The king-sized master bedroom features a modern en-suite, a walk-in wardrobe and a private balcony, so you can step out and feel the fresh ocean breeze on your face within seconds of waking.

Also upstairs is a study nook, a main bathroom with bath and overhead shower, and two other generous bedrooms with built-ins. Other notable highlights include a double lock-up garage with shelving, a concealed laundry room, air-conditioning units in all the bedrooms and the lounge area, and lots of internal storage space. 

Though this contemporary oasis provides a palpable sense of escapism, it's well placed to access beaches, shops and eateries, which are a short drive away in Collaroy or Narrabeen. Narrabeen Lake is a short bike ride away, and it's close to the local shops, parks and schools.

Strata & building report available.

    [description] => Renovated within the last two years, the paint, carpet & near new kitchen make the property ready to move into with no fuss!

After walking up the three stairs to the front door, you enter a comfortable & bright living and open dining area which then flows into the kitchen at the back of the house. The kitchen is fully renovated with a dishwasher and overlooks the sunny courtyard.

Every room is ready to move into with nothing to do, including the generous master bedroom that has everything you want - air-conditioning and a 3-door built-in wardrobe. The second bedroom is also a good size, perfect for guests, or a home office, while the bathroom has a separate shower and bath, as well as a separate toilet. There is plenty of storage throughout the house, with a linen cupboard in the hallway as well as an oversize laundry that can cater to whatever you need!

At the back of the property there is the charming courtyard which features a deck for entertaining and a space for a small easily maintained garden – and room for the tomato plants if you wanted! There is access to lock-up garage from here also, giving you another entry option to the house.

Lastly, the location of this villa is the cherry on top. It’s two minutes away from the centre of Eastwood with its shops, restaurants and fantastic transport options, but you would never realise that sitting at home in this peaceful home on its leafy street. 

The property will go to Auction on the 20th of October – this property is not to be missed!

    [description] => Positioned in a quiet and sleepy street that is mere moments from all the excitement of the Inner-West, this exceptional apartment provides the perfect city-fringe bolt hole or low-maintenance investment in a popular enclave. North facing with a leafy outlook, it's well-presented modern interiors offer the promise of immediate comfort.

Resting in a boutique security block, it boasts a very functional floorplan with a spacious living room. A clever wall provides separation from the sleek contemporary kitchen with combined dining whilst allowing connection via a servery space. The kitchen features stone benchtops and a quality array of stainless appliances including a dishwasher. The master suite with built in robes flows out to the balcony where cafe style dining or street watching can be enjoyed.

A study, modern bathroom with bath and combined laundry, reverse cycle air conditioning and a car space all make this apartment hard to go past. Being so close to all the action there really is no need for a car with bus services, the rail, Organic Food Markets, Marrickville Metro, the shops, cafes and theatres on Enmore Road and The Annette Kellerman Aquatic Centre all within walking distance.

    [description] => Lifestyle locations don't come much better than this. Positioned on a sought-after street less than a minute's walk from Manly Wharf and 300 metres from the beach, this is the perfect base to immerse yourself in Manly's vibrant beach, surf and café culture.

Situated within an Art Deco block with intercom access, this beautifully refreshed ground-floor apartment has been given a modern makeover. It showcases high ceilings, freshly painted walls, Art Deco cornicing and light-coloured timber floating floors, which help to maintain a pleasant, beachy vibe throughout.

The neat floorplan keeps the living area tucked to the rear of the building, where it is peaceful and quiet. Separate to living, the spacious kitchen is superbly equipped with stone countertops, a dishwasher and laundry facilities, which are all presented in fresh, neutral colours.

Both of the bedrooms are generously proportioned and include mirrored built-in wardrobes. And the well-presented bathroom features a bath with overhead shower.

Perfectly presented and ready to move into now, this is an astute purchase in a suburb that continues to thrive. Just over the road are Manly Wharf and the popular Manly Cove harbour beaches, where locals gather for picnics and sundowners. A short stroll in the other direction will take you to Manly and Queenscliff beaches, or take the scenic path to Shelley Beach.

With scenic walks and pathways, bustling cafes and restaurants, boutique shopping, and city-bound ferries or buses at your immediate disposal, this fabulous home in the heart of Manly will be popular with investors, professionals and first-time buyers.

    [description] => Perched on the top floor of a boutique block of only four, this three-bedroom apartment delivers generously on space and privacy. Featuring windows on three sides, it offers a wash of warm natural light and outlooks to swaying palm trees.

 

An open plan living area flows to an open balcony, perfect for soaking up the afternoon sunshine. Floorboards continue throughout the apartment, with a sleek black stone kitchen equipped with stainless steel appliances. All three bedrooms come with mirrored built-in robes, with the fully tiled bathroom offering a separate bath and shower. Additional highlights include an internal laundry and an oversized double car garage.

 

In a quiet neighbourhood, this well-kept block occupies a corner setting wrapped in green gardens. Close to an array of lifestyle attractions, the apartment is placed only a short walk from the sands of Maroubra Beach, Coral Sea Park, cafes, schools and Maroubra Junction.

    [description] => A golden opportunity for an extensive renovation or rebuild (STCA), this original circa 1960's double brick gem represents a unique foothold into the prestigious Middle Cove enclave. Completely untouched and ripe for a full-scale makeover or redevelopment, its ultra-handy location enjoys the convenience of express city buses virtually at its doorstep, with the eclectic shopping precincts of neighbouring Chatswood, Castlecrag and Northbridge only moments away. Set back on the high side of the street, the current dwelling offers a sunny north-facing living/dining space and two light-filled double bedrooms. Limited only by your imagination, this family-orientated lifestyle address lies within the Willoughby Girls High and Castle Cove Public School catchment areas. 

- Double brick construction with single-level layout awash with natural light 
- Spacious north-facing living area with fireplace flows to courtyard gardens
- Open plan kitchen and large bathroom both in need of a complete overhaul
- Bright and airy double bedrooms, high ceilings, space for carport/garage
- Elevated private leafy setting close to local shops and transport services
- Stroll to popular Willoughby Park Playground and St Aloysius' College Oval
- Enormous investment or redevelopment potential within a prime locale
- Moments to picturesque Middle Harbour, secluded beaches and moorings

Downstairs, the lower level accommodation features its own kitchen and abundant living space, with its own entrance for ultimate privacy. 

Features

Capturing leafy district views and bathed in natural light thanks to its desirable northerly orientation, the property includes double garaging with internal access, plantation shutters, ceiling fans, parquetry floors and ample room for a pool (STCA).
